## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We used a for loop to go through the list and aphend each item to the end of a new array. It seemed more efficient espcially since we could not use any python methods to reverse the list. Time was linear and space was also linear
