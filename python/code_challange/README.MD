# Pseudo queue
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 Create a new class called pseudo queue.
 Do not use an existing Queue.
 Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
 Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### pseudo Queue Methods should

### enqueue

  Arguments: value
Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

### dequeue

  Arguments: none
  Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
created the needed classes and included methods to achieve the needed objectives.
for enqueue big 0(n) it is dependend on the number of nodes being enqued in the stacks
for dequeue big 0(1) no additional space is being used by this method.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
