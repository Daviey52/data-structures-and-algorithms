# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. Write a function called zip lists

2. Arguments: 2 linked lists

3. Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below

4. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.

5. Try and keep additional space down to O(1)

6. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
we travased through the two link list, swith the .next from one list to the nesr. The big o for space is constant because we are just combining the two list. the big 0 for time is linear. it is dependent on the input len. for longer linklist it will take more time

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
